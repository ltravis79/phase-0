# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: Array of numbers
# Output: Number (float or integer)
# Steps to solve the problem.
# 
# Initialize a sum variable with value 0
# Loop through the array, adding each array value to the sum variable
# => Use .each method on the array to access each value
# => .each { |value| sum = sum + value }
# Return the sum variable

# 1. total initial solution
def total (arr_values)
	sum = 0
	arr_values.each { |value| sum = sum + value}
	return sum
end


# 3. total refactored solution



# 4. sentence_maker pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!
# Input: Array of words as strings
# Output: One string of concatenated words.
# Steps to solve the problem.
# Initialize sentence variable to hold full sentence
# Loop through each word in the array
# => If the first word, capitalize the word
# => Append the word to the sentence
# => If last word, append a period to the sentence, if not the last word, append a space.
# Return sentence variable

# 5. sentence_maker initial solution
def sentence_maker (arr_words)
	sentence = ''
	word = ''
	arr_words.each_index { |index| 
		word = arr_words[index]
		if index == 0
			word = word.to_s.capitalize
		end
		sentence = sentence + word.to_s

		if index == arr_words.length - 1
			sentence = sentence + '.'
		else
			sentence = sentence + ' '
		end

		return sentence
