**What is an integer?  WHat is a float?**
An integer is a whole number, like 1, 5, -20, or 1000.  A float is a number that includes a decimal, like 1.5, 3.14, or -2.75.

**What is the difference between float and integer division?  How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division is pretty standard division, and allows for a decimal remainder.  Integer division does not allow for decimals, and rounds down in the case of remainders.  For example, to divide 5 by 2 (5/2), with normal float division the answer is 2.5.  But if you do the same math using integer divsion, your answer would be rounded down to an even 2.
