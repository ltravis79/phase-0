**What does puts do?**
The puts command is used to output something to your screen, followed by a new line character.  It can be used to display text, numbers, or other information.

**What is an integer?  What is a float?**
An integer is a whole number, like 1, 5, -20, or 1000.  A float is a number that includes a decimal, like 1.5, 3.14, or -2.75.

**What is the difference between float and integer division?  How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
Float division is pretty standard division, and allows for a decimal remainder.  Integer division does not allow for decimals, and rounds down in the case of remainders.  For example, to divide 5 by 2 (5/2), with normal float division the answer is 2.5.  But if you do the same math using integer divsion, your answer would be rounded down to an even 2.

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**


**What is the difference between integers and floats?**
Integers are whole numbers that don't include any decimals, while floats are numbers that do include decimals.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**
Float division will divide two numbers and return a decimal if needed.  Integer division however will divide the numbers and then round down the answer to the closest whole number.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**
Strings are text, as opposed to numbers.  Anywhere you plan on storing or displaying a text value, like a word or name, you would use a string.  You can also have a string that includes numbers, but you won't be able to perform any arithmetic on it.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**
Local variables are like containers that your program uses to hold information.  You would want to use variables so that you can reuse them in your code without having to rewrite the same values, and they also allow you to change the value without rewriting your code.  Variables help to make aspects of your code reuseable.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
I found this challenge pretty easy, but at the same time it was a very good review of the basics.  I also found the rspec part of it interesting, having never used rspec to test code before, so that was a new concept for me.
