# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used map! to operate on the array because it will iterate through each item in the array and manipulate the item in place.
# I then used is_a?(Integer) to determine if the item was in fact an integer so that we can add to the number, otherwise we don't change anything.
# For the hash I used each_key to iterate through the available keys since we want to modify every item.  Then I explicitly used the key to set the new value

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
