<!--
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	I found it easy to decide what some elements of the webpage should be in HTML, but tricky to decide for others.  For example, the bulleted list of links was obvious to use a <UL>.  But some of the page header information, like the company address, was more unclear.
How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	Researching semantic elements went well, although I still find it difficult to think of the elements semantically rather than based on their format.  In particular <h1>, <h2>, etc.  I keep thinking of the elements' size and the formatting that come with them instead of just how they should be interpreted semantically.
How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We did pretty well with best practices, but we did accidentally start to try and format some bold text.  We did notice though and discussed taking out the formatting.
WHat seems good and bad about HTML?
	A good point about HTML to me is that because it is used for rendering text, the browser will still mostly display everything even if you've made a mistake in the HTML.  THe content may not look right, which helps to troubleshoot where the problems are.
	An issue though is that because HTML will still try to display your content even if there are problems, it would be very easy to put out a web site with flaws if you aren't careful with your work.
What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	The most helpful thing I have done so far is that I've started writing my closing tag immediately after the opening tag, then filling in the content.  I've found that helps me avoid forgetting to close my tags.
