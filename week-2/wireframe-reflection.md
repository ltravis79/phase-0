**What is a wireframe?**
A wireframe is a general outline of your webpage, it could be sketched out on paper, or drawn using tools on the computer.
**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
Wireframing can help you with the layout of your webpage.  It can show you how items may fit and flow together, prior to actually setting up the content.
**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
I enjoyed it a little bit.  I'm not a particularly artistic person, so sketching them out was a bit of a challenge.
**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
I made one small revision to my first wireframe, but generally stuck with the original layout.
**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
I had some problems getting the images to display correctly, I had to google for some markdown tips to remind myself about the proper paths to use.
**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
I found getting the images to display correctly to be pretty tedious and difficult for me.
