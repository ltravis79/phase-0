2.  What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary purpose is going to be to get my information out there for potential employers.  It will be featuring information about me, my background, and a blog.

3.  What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
I think my target audience's interests will be hiring, and possibly focused on healthcare business improvements, since that is my background.  I would like to present my background info and highlight that experience.

4.  What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
Their primary action would be a combination of viewing my portfolio and contacting me.

5.  What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
I think the main thing to remember about design and user experience is that the usability of the site is not the only important aspect.  In addition to being able to use the site, the user needs to have a positive experience, and if they dislike some of the features you have designed, they may not continue to use the site.

6.  What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is the process of designing a site to be not only functional, but a positive experience for the user.  It's important because with so many different websites out there, if the user doesn't have a positive experience, they may just find an alternative and no longer use your site.

7.  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found learning some of the differences between the phases of design process to be tedious, in particular the early stages, because in my head they seem to be very similar, so I had to re-read to make sure I was understanding the differences.
