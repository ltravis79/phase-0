 			<h1>Version Control</h1>
 		</header>
 		<main>
 			<p>In programming and development, there's a vitally important concept called version control. There are a lot of tools out there to help with it, but I'm going to discuss two of them - git and GitHub.</p>
 			<p>Why version control to begin with? The simple answer could just be for your own sanity. Version control means keeping track of the changes you've made to your program or documents, and more importantly being able to go back to a previous version if you need to. For instance, you could be working on changes to your program, but maybe the new concept you were trying out isn't really going to work, or turns out to not be the direction you want to go. Well if you've been using version control, it's really easy to back up from where you are to what the old version was. Without it, you might have to scramble to find the right files, or worse yet, redo the entire old version!</p>

Reflection Questions...
1.  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I think the only tags used today that I keep coming back to were just the html, head, title, body, and links, because those are the basics of any site.  This challenge actually really helped me understand some of the semantic elements a little better, so I know that going forward I will start coming back to the main, aside, and other elements, even though I haven't been so far.

2.  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
As you move down your html file, the elements get laid out on the page from left to right.  Certain tags will cause breaks where the next element moves down the page, but other than that, they will add to the right as long as there is room on the page.

3.  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Snippets were a big thing to learn today.  I think I'll definitely look into creating some for use in the future, once I get a good outline built for things I know I'll use over and over again.  It wasn't presented in the actual challenge, but our guide also showed us a nice shortcut to open the webpage in a browser directly from sublime, rather than moving to the browser, opening a tab, and navigating to the file.  It was a lot easier and faster.
